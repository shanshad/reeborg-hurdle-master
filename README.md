# Reeborg's World: Universal Hurdle Solver

This project contains a Python algorithm written to solve **all levels** of the hurdle challenges in [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html). The code handles various obstacles and adapts to different patterns using smart logic.

## 🚀 Features
- Handles walls of variable height
- Automatically navigates with minimal logic
- Uses `right_is_clear()`, `wall_in_front()`, and `turn_right()` logic efficiently

## 📜 How It Works
The robot:
1. Turns right if possible and moves
2. Moves forward if the path is clear
3. Turns left and climbs if it hits a wall
4. Recovers and continues the path after the hurdle

## 🛠️ Usage
Paste this code inside Reeborg’s World editor and run it on any hurdle map.

## 🧠 Why This Matters
This shows how basic algorithms can be extended to dynamic conditions — a stepping stone toward more advanced pathfinding and AI logic.
